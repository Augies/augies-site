# Augie's Site

Hello! I'm Augustus. I often go by Augie, also (Hence the GitHub username). 

I've been writing code since high school. I primarily have experience in Site Reliability Engineering and DevOps, but I love all things software.

This repository is the source code for my personal website, which will contain an overview of my career goals, general information about me, and perhaps some of my favorite recipes :)

### Objectives
- First and foremost, I want to become **more comfortable with front-end development** and have a way of learning new development concepts outside of my job
- My website can be composed of **multiple repositories**, allowing for **modularity**:
   - Eaxmple: `https://augustusshald.com/recipes` displays content from the repository `augies-recipes`
   - The root of the site is `augies-site`
- **Initializing new site repositories requires relatively little toil**. I want to be able to initialize the repository from a template, create the DNS record, and add it to the base site's routing to get new repositories up and running.
- Overall **progress on this project will be tracked using a Kanban Jira board**. I'm hoping I can use GitHub actions of some sort to automatically generate tickets from GitHub issues, with each site repository having its own Epic.
- I want to **document my processes for other developers looking to learn**. My collection of projects should serve as useful starting-points for getting started on new concepts, and I want to be able to go back and review anything I've forgotten. If I can't explain what I'm doing, can I really say I understand it?


## About

I decided to begin working on a personal website to get a better understanding of front-end development and learn some new concepts and skills. 

I began developing software my sophomore year of high school by writing basic Java programs and Minecraft server plugins in [Spigot](https://www.spigotmc.org/). Since then, I've mainly stuck to writing back-end software in Typescript + AWS CDK, or in Groovy + Spring Boot. I've also picked up a fair bit of experience in VueJS and Thymeleaf, but I definitely do not have the same confidence as I do when writing backend code. 

By designing this website, I hope to become more comfortable with front-end development and also learn a few new concepts. 

In particular, **I plan to <u>continue</u> learning the following**:
- CSS
   - I have basic knowledge of flexbox, margins, relative spacing, etc. However, I often have difficulty understanding how modifying container styling affects upstream/downstream components.
- Web Components
   - I've done some work on Vue Component libraries in the past. I understand the struggles of ensuring that all web developers are given tools to ensure brand-consistent design when some teams use other front-end frameworks
   - The idea of a framework-ambiguous way of maintaining consistent branding sounds really cool, and I'd like to gain more familiarity with how useful web components may/may not be.
- Material Design Concepts
   - Honestly, I've heard this term thrown around often and don't have a solid understanding of what it *means*. I want to determine what sets Material design apart from other paradigms and what its upsides/downsides are through hands-on learning.
- Open-Source development and CI/CD
   - I haven't had time to do much open-source development since high school, so I'm not too familiar with the ecosystems available to develop, test, and deploy code outside of what I'm used to (SonarQube, Jenkins, and AWS CDK).
